## Part 2

### Q1 (Atari game)

I played the game called Deadly Duck. The game is similar to space invaders, where your character only moves on the x-axis at the bottom of the screen, and is trying to shoot the aliens——which are also firing projectiles at your character. There were no apparent difficulties when running the game. However, there were no explicit directions on how to move your character or how to start the game——I had to guess how this to play. Stella was overall easily documented, and the file navigation was intuitive to use. However, Stella did not provide adequate information on the computer keyboard mappings to an Atari 2600 controller. Overall, I had a positive experience playing the game and using the emulator.

### Q2 (HW emulator assumptions)

As new architectures are developed, hardware emulators must also be updated to be compatible with the new architecture. Hardware emulators in general are created so that *old software* can be run on newer computers. If the hardware emulators aren't updated for the new architecture, then someone may need to create an emulator to emulate the hardware that the hardware emulator was built for. This problem will continue to occur as new software is created. Overall, this affects the feasibility of hardware emulation because there must be teams of people who are willing to continually update the software. Therefore, some government or company must be willing to fund the preservation hardware emulators. Nevertheless, hardware emulation is still much more effective than preserving old hardware and therefore, will probably continue to be used.

### Q3 (Comparing with other forms of preservation)

Similar to other forms of preservation, software preservation looks to prevent a record of human expression from being lost or altered. Unlike other forms of preservation, however, which are based around preventing physical objects from degrading or malforming over time, software preservation is based around preventing the software from being lost to technological development. This requires there to be specific documentation of how our current systems work such that they can be replicated on future hardware. In this way, software preservation also differs from traditional preservation in that it is intangible and is therefore harder to keep track of. While standards of software preservation should emphasize documentation of how our technology works and where our data is virtually stored, traditional preservation standards focus more on preventing objects from being physically damaged or misplaced.

### Q4 (Legal protections and obligation to pay)

* Individual response: 

I believe that preservationists should receive legal protections from copyright infringement. Especially if the preservationist works for a government or other reputable organization, the software would be in a protected environment. However, in many cases, the software becomes open source and is freely available to anyone on the internet. If the company that created the software is defunct, then their copyright protection effectively doesn’t exist and there is therefore no harm in open sourcing the software. Similarly, if the company doesn’t exist or is no longer used, then there is no obligation to pay for it. Wordperfect, for example, is now owned by Corel corporation which is a software company headquartered in Canada. While they own the Wordperfect copyright, the product is, according to my research, rarely used and not maintained. Since the company is not dedicating financial resources to maintaining the software, then there should be no obligation to pay them for using the software. On the other hand, if a company’s product is still widely used, then it clearly dedicates resources to maintain the platform. However, if old files can no longer work with the new platform, then the company is at fault for not creating backwards compatibility, and therefore, should also not be compensated for legacy software. In the same regard, I also think that the distribution of legacy software is preservation, since legacy software is rarely used and not maintained by its creators.

* Discussion with partner: 

My partner and I reached the conclusion that, while digital preservationists should receive legal protections, they must go through the proper channels to be certified to distribute data. Moreover, it’s important that the software should be distributed in a closed environment. Also, we both saw preservation as a way to protect antiquated/obsolete software, not to distribute software that is still widely used to this day. That is, this should depend on the current usage of the old software.


### Q5 (Responsibilities of stakeholders)

After discussing our thoughts, we were able to come to a consensus. We believe that public bodies should not be the primary curators of digital content, because public bodies do not always work to enact the public’s best interest. For example, public bodies are often limited in funding and have been known, throughout history, to censor or misconstrue culture, history, and art. There is no guarantee that the same will not happen with digital content. Public interest is also largely swayed by mass media and marketing, and therefore, different stakeholders could push to prioritize or not preserve different agendas. Instead, private curators should work collaboratively with public entities to curate digital content. The public entities should have the ability to curate content on their own—assuming they go through the correct channels to protect piracy. We also both believe that the government should financially incentivize private companies to focus actively on preservation, as this will help other preservationists better maintain software and hardware. Private incentivization will more likely lead to a higher quality of software maintenance in general. Lastly, we believe that only the creators themselves should be allowed to completely bar the preservation attempts of a particular software—governments should only be able to do so with the consent of the original creators of said software.


### Q6 (Expensive taste vs public good)

* Individual response: 

I wholeheartedly believe that legacy software in general is for public good. Legacy software, for one, increases information transparency and improves data communication throughout the world. For example, many less developed countries used older software, and some data types that may be unusable by our current devices. If certain governments or corporations did not invest in legacy software, then there would be a gap in information that could be transmitted between two governments. In addition, there are many government files from the past sixty years that may be stored on floppy disks and old software formats. These documents are important to preserve from a historical standpoint. In addition, there may be future use cases of this information that are unknown to us today. Legacy software can also allow for more open source software which is overall better for the tech environment. Open source software is better from a cybersecurity, efficiency and agility standpoint, and allows the public to also view old data. All in all, it is crucial to identify and create emulators or find alternative ways to use legacy software.

* Response to partner: 

Byron’s argument is quite strong; however, I disagree with a few points. For one, I want to challenge the assumption that there is only a small amount of data that needs to be preserved. For historical academic studies, along with other preservation efforts, I’d be confident in stating that there is a significant amount of data that needs to be stored. In addition, it is unclear how all the data may be used in the future. Thus, it’s important to develop legacy software now that can be used to translate the data from the past and continue to transfer data to the future. Especially as data privacy concerns increase, it will be more important to create software that is backwards compatible and can be preserved for decades to come.
